This thesis was completed at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). The work investigates an exotic
group of particles called anyons, which could be used in [Topological Quantum Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer).
[Topological Quantum Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory) is used to determine the
likelihood of braiding these particles. Which is the crucial operation allowing the particles to faciliate quantum computations.
