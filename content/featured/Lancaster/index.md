My first masters thesis completed at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). The work investigates exotic
group of particles called anyons, which could be used in [Topological Quantum Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_computer).
The plausiblilty of using these particles to perform such computations is investigated using [Topological Quantum Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory)
