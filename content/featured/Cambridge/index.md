My masters thesis at the [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) investigates the geometry underlying [Dimensional Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory) (or [Compactification](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(physics)#:~:text=In%20string%20theory%2C%20compactification%20is,the%20universe%20is%20made%20with.>)) in [String Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20string%20theory%20is,and%20interact%20with%20each%20other.). This work hints at a possibile generalisation of the underlying geometry of [Gauge Theory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics)>), which is currently constructed using [Principal bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle) to instead use special classes of [Lie Algebroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebroid).
