As my thesis for my masters degree at [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), I wrote an essay investigating the geometry underlying [Dimensional Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory) in [String Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20string%20theory%20is,and%20interact%20with%20each%20other.). This work may hint at a possible mathematical extenstion of [Gauge Theory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory_(mathematics)>) which is currently constructed using [Principal bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_bundle) as the underlying structure to a more general stucture [Lie Algebroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebroid)
