Hello! I'm Peter, a data scientist based in Belfast, UK.

I studied [Theorectical Physics & Mathematics](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/theoretical-physics-with-mathematics-msci-hons-f3g1/) as undergraduate & graduate student at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/), where I places #1 overall.
I then embarked on what is widely considered one of the most difficult mathematics courses in the world at the [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) studying for a [MASt in Applied Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos).

Shortly after graduating from the [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), I decided to take some time away from academia, passing up an offer for a PhD programme studying the geometry of String Theory.

I joined the data science team at [SimplyIOA](https://www.simplyioa.com/) where I work on everything data. Projects range from ETLs using internal and external sources to ML projects, such as, record linkage, retention modelling & pdf table extraction on a daily basis.

My goal is to become a machine/deep learning researcher. This website will serve as both a personal portfolio and also a place for me to share my notes and findings along the journey.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
