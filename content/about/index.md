Hello! I'm Peter, a data scientist based in Belfast, UK.

I have attained masters degrees in Mathematics & Theorectical Physics from [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/).

After graduating from [University of Cambrige](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), I decided to take some time away from academia, passing up a PhD offer to work in String Theory.
